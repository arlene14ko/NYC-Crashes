## About The Repository
This repository will show you how to clean a dataset, the sample dataset consists of 100,000 data. 

### Miscellanous information

An example dataset data_100000.csv has already been downloaded in the assets/ folder, which has 100000 rows for around 21.5MB. The full file is more than 10x larger but it is not required to use the full file. However, it would be good to use at least 100 000 rows for the final version. 

If you want to download a differently sized dataset, you can use the script `download.py` located in assets/ It will create a CSV file similar to data_100000.csv in the the  current directory.

See the usage of the script using

                      python download.py -h
                      
You will need the sodapy library for downloading the data set.

                      pip install sodapy
